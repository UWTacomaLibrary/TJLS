## About
The Japanese Language School Oral Histories is a collection of oral histories about Nihongo Gakko, Tacoma’s Japanese Language School. The school was opened on May 21, 1912, by the Tacoma Japanese Association at 411 S 15th Street and was a source of community and education for the Japanese and Japanese American community until 1942, when it was closed due to the incarceration and internment of Japanese and Japanese Americans by the US Government.

The University of Washington Tacoma acquired the property in 1997, which had been mostly vacant for over 50 years and had deteriorated to such a degree that it couldn’t be restored with historic integrity.

Professors Lisa Hoffman and Mary Hanneman received grants from the Founder's Endowment at UW Tacoma and the Ethnic Studies in the United States Fund at UW Seattle in 2003, to collect oral histories of the former students of the school, recording more than 40 interviews. A selection of these oral histories is exhibited here.
